<p>As of 2021-03-28 16:03, as I am reviewing my gantt chart that I made half a month ago, I can stay that I didn't move forward at all in terms of excel and statistics. What I have been doing mostly was relaxing, playing games and taking care of people around me more than of this learning project I have come up with. I guess you need both. Oh yeah, been also doing the "Learning how to learn course". Learning a bunhc, just need something to apply it to. I got loads to apply it to, but I just need to get myself to do it. Uhm, after this.. or.. after that. How silly my mind is jumping from one to the other, trying to escape the unpleasant. Should I try to forget the motivation and just set myself one pomodoro and say I'll work only for 25mins? And as I am working, the mind sees there is nothing steresstufl about it so it will come to enjoy the process. Poor little baby just wants everything to be safe and calm, that's why it's doing it to me. Trying to protect itself form the unpleasentness. That's way more than I intended to write. The egg thingy just rang, 4th pomodoro, lunch time. Love this.  </p>
