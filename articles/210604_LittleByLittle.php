<h2>Little by little</h2>


<p>Just came back to the library after another "desinfection" thing for 30min, was sitting in the square, sun was shining, was reading the Turing paper, eating some ice cream, taking a walk. </p>

<p>As I was coming back to the library, I saw a guy that was literally burned by the sun. I thought... Is it better for me to sit in the sun 10 minutes a day and get an okey tan or sit once for 5 hours a day and get a sick tan.. </p>


<p>Maybe its the same with learning to program. Why don't I learn little by little daily, same like doing duolingo little by little daily, same like learning guitar little by little daily... </p>

<p>At least I would be doing something, learning something little by little and progressing little by little. Instead of picking a subject, going all in and then burning out.</p>

<p>Little bit of Js, php, spaninsh, kali, python and etc daily...</p>
