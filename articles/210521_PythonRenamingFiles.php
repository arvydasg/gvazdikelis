<p>Dude, I just renamed like 30 files wiht a single button click. Python is amazing. Programming is amazing. This is exactly why I started learning how to program.. to first of all aid me wiht tasks in my everyday life, then help me financially in the future and allow me the freedom to travel.</p>
<p>This is great, my first simple, but useful task completed :) </p>
