<p>Hey look at me, once again typing in vim on Linux without any plugins. Writing all the html tags by hand.</p>


<h2>Confused</h2>

<p>So, my current interests are: Kali, js, php, vim, linux shell, python.</p>

<p>Seems like every day I find something more intersting than I learned was studying before. Because of the internet situation - I started to read more. Finally opened the humble bundle thingy, found some interesting books, about shell, python and so on... If I was using linux until now and would not have changed to windows, I would be quite good in both Linux and vim by now I think. So my question still exists... should I do things little by little... many things at the same time but spending little time to each or take only JAVASCRIPT from now on ant put my 100% effort into it. Leaving it as that for now.. </p>  


<h2>Internet</h2>

<p>Today its evening of Wednesday. Since monday I have been without internet on my phone, meaning - no internet at home as well. But I stil had to study and do the ecommerce website for the sausage people, so every day I would spend in the library just 10min on bike from me. So far its going good, the only thing I am worried about is my bike getting stolen and the heavy laptop that I have to carry with me all the way there and back. But that is okay, the time in the library is worth it. I spend 0 time wasting my time there doing random things or waching youtube. I know that from 11:00 to 11:30 and from 15:00 to 15:30 - is the time when the room I am staying in has to be ventilated. What that means is that I am forced to get up and take a break. If not it, I doubt that I would take breaks. I love them so far. I go the the very heart of my city, lie on the bench in the sun and read a book. I would never do that if I stayed the whole day in my appartment. Also during one of the breaks I am forced to eat or go to the gym... </p>  

<p>I feel that having breaks is important, I experience it myself, so when the week is over and I am back with the internet, I will know how to use it more mindfully.</p>



<h2>Linux</h2>

<p>Again I got this feeling of my computer being dirty with all the dual boot windows and ubuntu, so I decided to install Linux solo and maybe run a virtual box of windows when I need to use Lightroom to edit my pictures and so on. Struggling a little wiht it once a gain, but the muscle memory helps me. I need to get some addons for vim, I would like to start reading manuals for vim and shell commands, get better to know them... would like to work with tiling window manager, like dwm, but on a clean slate.. something like arch maybe. Now on ubuntu I can not get it working properly, there are some gliches when I change between the tabs in dwm and yeah... just having all that "bloat".. it better wouldnt be there. VIM man... ctrl+z command that I got used to when in Windows now is messing up my vim experience. I press it when I want to undo something and my whole document is gone, gg :)</p>
