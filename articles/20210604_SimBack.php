<h2>Sim card back</h2>

<p>Main reason to sit down and write this because Linux started behaving weirdly.. as I open a program (browser for example), it would show that it has been opened, but I wouldn't see the window, couldn't interract with it.</p>

<p>It is a first time such thing has happened. I could open anki, could open terminal and so on, but not a browser, not a "localbyflywheel" or "xampp".</p>

<p>And so I don't want to wait until tomorrow or for monday to fix this, I would like to find a solution now so I can continue watching my downloaded tutorials and follow them without any prblems...</p>


<p>Alright so hi again. Will make this quick and perhaps later will edit it more.</p>

<p>The situation now is this - it has been 5 days since I have taken my sim-card with an internet from my smartphone and put it inside a flip phone that I bought purely for this experiment and 
honestly I wanted it for a really long time.</p>

<p>Friday evening, I am sitting at home... you know what, instead of trying to fix my linux and install arch and all that, why don't I just go get some sweet stawberries, sit in the balcony and read a book in the sun...</p>

<p>Just came back to the computer after finishing reading the turing test... it has been a while on my shelf, but probably wasn't the good time to read it yet, didnt get much of it.</p>

<h2>Thoughts of week without 24/7 internet</h2>
<p>I loved not being able to take picture of whateve moment I was in, I was able to just be in it</p>
<p>I loved to be forced out of the library to take a break from "coding", researching, because I would have never done that by myeself</p>
<p>I loved being dependent on the internet in the library, if I wanted to know something new - I had to go there and connect to the internet.</p>
<p>I loved the bits of time that I got to do nothing. When I am bored.. I would just sit down and look around, or most often I would pick up kindle and start reading. Way better than mindless scrolling.</p>
<p>I loved the time that I had when I came back from the library after 6pm. I would know okay I have 3-4 hours before I hit the bed, if there was nothing urgent to do on my computer, then I would get up and move.</p>
<p>I loved that I took time to lear someting new.. I mean I would have done that otherwise as well, but this time if I have one video that I donwnloaded, I coudnt just skip it and watch a different one 
as soon as I was bored, I had to stick with it, watch it until the end and usually I was happy I did that becauce I learned something.</p>
<br>

<p>Same can go with all the things I didnt like. Sometimes yes, I wanted to have my phone there to take and share that picture, yes I wanted to google an answer to something and yeah sometimes some music would be nice..</p>

<p>I felt like I was back in Nepal Vipassana center... only calm moments around me... not many distractions, mind is no constantly bombarded with music, unlimited amount of information at my fingertips 24/7,
no music to get me distracted, no other kinds of bullshit... This kind of lifestyle is my preferred actually.</p>
<p>But since I am not in a Vipassana center, I shouldn't totally restrict myself from things.. Balance is everything, right? Why don't I take these lessons and observations about myself and apply them
in my days that are ahead.. I am sure I will be more mindful.</p>
<p>Everything in moderation...</p>
<p>Last p tag. I will have to end here, going to insert the sim card into my smartphone and connect to the interwebs once again, but this time more mindful. 21:49</p>
