	<h1>Black boxing statistics</h1>


<p>2021-03-30</p>


<p>Excited about starting to learn python on April 1st, so thought I will try to look into something I should have looked into during this whole month of March... Last day huh. Like always. Hm.. anyway, some black boxing of some statistics terms.</p>

r
<p>MEAN - the average of the numbeers. Add up all numbers, divide by how many numbesr there are.</p>


<p>MEDIAN - middle of a sorted list of numbers. If can't find the middle number, add the 2 close ones and divide them by two.</p>


<p>MODE - Numbers in order, count how many of each number, which appears most often is the mode. Two modes - bimodal. Grouping is useful also.</p>

<p>VARIANCE + (standard deviation) - the average of the squared differences from the Mean. <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html">Dogs</a> </p>

<p>IQR - interquartile range - numbers in order, find median. Take from both sides medians again and then minus one from the other, you get the IQR.</p>


<p>CORRELATION and CAUSALITY - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROpbdO-gRUo">explanation Khan.</a> </p>

<p>MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD - looks cool. Finding the best fit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XepXtl9YKwc"> first stat quest video.</a></p>

<p>Was learning more statistics, feeling bad that I left it behind. Have some time before the python course that I registered for, so will catch up with stats.</p>



<p>Was looking at Khan accademy statistics course and found some things that I struggle with. The first paragraph presented the two way table and it was so confusing for me. The second day I crcked it.</p>

<p>Okay back to the business. Since I dont have a proper notebook that I dream about, I will just write my notes here and improve my vim and html skils at the same time.</p>

<p>Point means one or more value is there, then other side the same, then the meat of the distribution is where the box is. Line is the median - the middle number. Distribution is skewed to the left. more values on the left.</p>

<p>Outlier - data point is way off from all the other data points.</p>

<p>Cluster - group of data. 0-2 days is a cluster for example.</p>

<p>Standard deviation - how far on average we are form the mean. Cool, makes sense in the last sentence of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-population/v/range-variance-and-standard-deviation-as-measures-of-dispersion?modal=1" target = "_blank">This video.</a></p>

<p>Few notes on variance and how to find it. From the video above as well. Just wannah have those here.</p>
