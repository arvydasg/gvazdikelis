  <p>Hey.</p>
  <p>You might not notice this, but it has been a while I have written here</p>
  <p>A few reasons being that I have put linux, vim, data science stuff on the shelf for a while.</p>
  <p>I offered my help to Julytes friend that is starting a sausage business and needed a website.</p>
  <p>I am using wordpress and building that. I have also noticed that I really need to have strong hmtl and css skills to be able to build a proper wordpress site. I also noticed I should know some php as well</p>
  <p>So during my time in Vilnius, it is 4th week now, I have been learning that. Most of the time got taken by figuring wordpress out, now since that is done, I am looking into hmtl and css and that is getting more clear.</p>
  <p>What I have learned now is how to color the things, got an idea how to work wiht the blocks and make stuff responsive in mobile. Tomorrow I think I will nail that with Steph's classe.</p>
  <p>You might think why don't I learn that right now - I'll tell you why. I am trying to divide my time a little. For now there are 3 parts. Python - Html/css - wordpress.</p>
  <p>As of now I have done the first two, time will be for wordpress.</p>


  <dl>
    <dt>Python</dt>
    <dd>Dalykai kurie sekasi: karel done. Short input and math stuff is clear. What I want to learn: how to use external files/programs from python to start doing some useful stuff.</dd>
    <dt>Html/css</dt>
    <dd>Dalykai kurie sekasi: basic text editing, styling, etc. What I would like to know: how to work with those responsive design boxes, mobile layouts and etc.</dd>
    <dt>Wordpess</dt>
    <dd>Dalykai kurie sekasi: manual backups, elementor templates for various parts of the site (head, nav, footer, single page etc). What I would like to know: how to edit php files and find a way to show only what I want. Make website faster as well.</dd>
