        <p>Dind't sort the thoughts here, takes too much time.. Idk let's say these are the notes and I will clean them later as I review.</p>

        <strong>
        <p>I just realized that everything can be summarized in these points</p>



      <ul>
          <li>Study groups - discussing new material, testing each other. CRUCIAL</li>
          <li>Teaching - teaching other just shows you the gaps in your knowledge.</li>
          <li>Deliberate - practice. Doing hard things over the easy things.</li>
          <li>Little bit - wet your appetite with the topic, learn the rest later.</li>
          <li>Stuff adds up - it only gets easier</li>
          <li>Set goals - deadlines and missions. Crucial for not wandering arond...</li>
      </ul>
        </strong> 


<p>Me now as of 2021-03-29 - Don't have a goal anymore. Got discouraged by others that if I set up big goals I will burn out. I am still trying to get something done each day but I am choosing easy tasks such as doing this sort of course. (I keep talking about it as it is something negative but perhaps it will be the most useful thing I could do). And I am spending a lot of time, uncalcualted amount of time on the tasks.. bro.. I need those time sheets again like in UCN, I need to track my time and sort the priorities otherwise I will feel like I am going nowhere for the next month.</p>



<p>Transfer - the idea that a chunk you’ve mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities.</p>


<p>Steps for making a chunk:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Practice until you can sense the big-picture context</li>
    <li>Understadn the basic idea</li>
    <li>Focused attention</li>
</ol>


<p>DELIBERATE PRACTICE - Focusing intently on the parts of the problem that are <strong>the most difiult</strong> to you.</p>


<h2>Chunking</h2>

<ul>
    <li>As you gain more experience in chunking in any particular subject, you will see that the chunks you are able to create are bigger—in some sense, the ribbons are longer.</li>
    <li>Concepts and problem-solving methods you might learn for physics can be very similar to chunked concepts in business.</li>
    <li>When you are trying to figure something out, if you have a good library of chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution by—metaphorically speaking—“listening” to whispers from your diffuse mode. Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems.</li>
    <li>"Chunking" involves compressing information more compactly--this is part of why it is easier to draw a "chunked" idea or concept into mind.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Stuff on learning</h2>


<ul>
    <li>Although practice and repetition are important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it’s interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity. It’s where you leave the world of practice and repetition and begin thinking more independently.</li>
    <li>Once you’ve got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn’t strengthen the kinds of long-term memory connections you want to have strengthened. Worse yet, focusing on one technique is a little like learning carpentry by only practicing with a hammer. After a while, you think you can fix anything by just bashing it</li>
    <li>Interleaving your studies—making a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials—can sometimes seem to make your learning more difficult. But in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.</li>
    <li>One significant mistake students sometimes make in learning is jumping into the water before they learn to swim. In other words, they blindly start working on homework without reading the textbook, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or speaking with someone knowledgeable. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in the focused-mode pinball machine without paying any real attention to where the solution truly lies.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Acetylcholine - affects focused learning and attention.</li>
    <li>Seratonin - affects social life adn risk-taking behavior.</li>
    <li>Dopamine - signals in relation to unexpected reward.</li>
</ul>





<p>simple recall. Remember, connecting concepts isn't going to help if you don't have the concepts already well-embedded in the brain. It's like trying to learn higher strategy in chess without having learned the basics about how the pieces move.</p>

<p>When the text is open right in front of you, it fools you into thinking that you know the material. But you only really know that material for certain when you can recall the material--or at least the key ideas--WITHOUT the text open in front of you.</p>


<p>Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an idea, concept, or action, you don’t need to remember all the little underlying details; you’ve got the main idea—the chunk—and that’s enough.</p>


<p>People get caught up in low efficiency,
low intensity studying habits and because they learned a lot slower with those methods,they end up spending a lot more time studying.


<br>
<br>
<p>Because they're spending a lot more time studying which is naturally more tiring, you go into less efficient studying methods.</p>


<p>It's a little bit like exercising. It's as if you're not getting the exercise results you want so you extend your workout from one hour to two hour but now you're not working out as more intensely so you make it four hours. Now, you really can't do more than just a light jog for four hours or maybe just walking and eventually it eats up all of your time but you're not having the intensity your muscles in your body really need to get physical improvement.</p>




Similarly, I think the same is true with mental improvement. So, what I tried to do is I tried to pick specific chunks of time that I'm going to study and they don't have to be too big. So, right now I'm learning Korean over these three months and I'm actually only doing three to four hours a day of studying time which is considerably less than I would say a typical full-time students studying Korean. But I think that I've been making quite good progress just because <strong>the actual time I'm spending is highly focuses this kind of test yourself feedback</strong> so that I am using things like Anki for flashcards and I'm doing actual conversations one-on-one with the tutor and these things are very efficient but they are <strong> also very intense</strong> but the <strong>benefit of that is that you have more time and you can relax outside of it.</strong></p>

<p>This is exactly what lady is talking about, deliberate practice. Time Ferris 4 hour workweek, now this guy with learning languages. This is the key.. Learning smart... not wasting time to these other things. Does it mean that what I am doing is one of those wasteful activities? Can be..</p>

<p>Learning by solving <strong>solved</strong> problems.</p>


<p>Continuing to practice/stuyd something after your practice or master it in a session - overlearning.</p>

<p>Repeating what you know is well... easy... this action can also bring an illusion of competence towards the full range of the material when you have actually learned only the easy stuff.</p>

<p>DELIBERATE PRACTICE - focusing only on what's difficult. (Exactly what I am not doing now by writing some articles and stuff instead of learning the Data science)</p>


<p>To know HOW is not enough. Knowing WHEN to use a technique, algorithm or a word is as much if not even more important.</p>


<h2>Programming is a team sport</h2>

<blockquote>Must find your team as quickly as possible and make sure that the members of your team are very serious about their studies as well.</blockquote>


<p>Keeping your nose to the grind is fine, but not for too long. Take breaks. The dude's break is watching cartoons or the woman's - reading gossip magazines. All of us have something we get away from the stuff with, turing off all the mental stuff and enjoying whatever stupid is in front of us. It is not only good for us it is mandatory. I think we all know what guilty pleasure I will be having during my breaks.</p>


<h2>Study groups</h2>


<p>Challenge each other. TEACHING is one of the best ways to learn!!! Imagine trying to explain a subject to someone just to find out you don't know how to start to do so. Means you don't understand it well enough. Explainign something is a simple way will only show that you know what you are talking about. If you are discussing with someone about a subject and someone disagrees you have to prove your point, all this is just strenghtening the learning!!! Makes sense?</p>

<p>If you are trying to explain something and you are using some vague abstract terms, it just shows that you don't really understand the subject and this is exactly what you need to be working on.</p>



<h2>Wrong as quikcly as possible</h2>


<p>Try to dive in the position where you can be wrong as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>While listening to a lecture there is not really a way to get antyhing wrong. No real way to check what you have learned.</p>

<p>Getting to problems as quikcly as possible, trying to solve them and failing while doing so. Great way to learn. Better than just listening or reading. Learning languages, programming and so on. Good stuff.</p>



<p>Just little steps at a time, litle projects at a time. Stuff adds up. Stuff piles up and it ONLY GETS EASIER.</p>

<h2>Concrete exciting projects</h2>


<p>Always have a mission. 3 months for example. No concrete goals - ah I will just learn it.." there is no specific motivation. It tapers off and you don't atchieve that much. Like the guy learning languages. 3 months in france just reading books and going to classes - can't speark. Spending 3 months in some other country and TALKING to natives and so on, is able to speak the chosen language.</p>
