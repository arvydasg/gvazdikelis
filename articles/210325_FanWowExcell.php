<p>Alright, hi. Two weeks of my learning excel and statistics are nearly over, and what I am doing? Installing windows so I could play video games.</p>

<p>On ubuntu, I don't have excel. I see everyone using excel and I don't want to spend my time trying to do the same tasks with google sheets or some ubuntu alternative programs, because it won't be the same..  I prefer excel as well, don't know why. So, reason nr.1 why I need Windows.</p>


<p>There are some tasks that I need and want to do with my images... it is just way easier to modify them and sort them and pick the proper ones in the software that I am familiar with - Lightroom. To be learning another software (Gimp, darkroom or RawTherapee on top of learning Vim, Linux, data science stuff is a bit too much I feel. Especially after a month me trying to juggle all of those things at the same time and feeling like I am going through too much of unecessary struggle... Just get Windows and use Lightroom to sort all the pictures stuff you have been holding on your to-do list for months now... thats reason nr.2</p>

<p>Another reason is that I feel like I would like to give myself a break from learnign somehow. I know that I tend to get into things <a href="addict.php">too fast and too deep,</a>  which is unhealthy sometimes, that is why I started to do the <a href="learn.php">Learing how to learn course</a> in which I have already, during the fist week found a lot of "mistakes" with the way I approach learning. One is I see learning anything as a sprint. The more time I put in, the faster and more I will learn. But I start to learn to see it as a <strong>marathon, rather than the sprint.</strong> I must have some breaks, I must reward myself somewhow and that reward will be wow. My addiction that I had for years. Hehe :D I don't know if it is because I feel a little bit sick now from walking outside half naked during the first days of the "spring" or I am conciously letting myself get loose into something I rarely find a smooth way out of, but maybe I should try to live with my flaws rather than shutting them down, because I noticed that it is like a rubber band, the more I pull it, the more it backfires later. Keep the balance. everything in moderation. Let's try this Arvy ;) </p>


<p>Oh yes there is another reason. The fan of my laptop while I am running ubuntu. It is constantly at nearly critical high temperature, which doesn't allow me to focsu.. the sound that my poor 8 year old laptop is making is hard to listen to. Instead of looking for a cure to this, I will just remove the problem, whihc is - ubuntu after every clean install. </p>

<p>Also, I can see this as a good learning opportunity. I have never tried to dual boot anything on my or someone else's computer. I just remember Pali Pali dude from my Uni that had windows on his mac for similar reasons. That's it. Now I will know how to do it as well.</p>


 <p>And yes, I will continue using ubuntu and other linux systems for my daily learning/website stuff and pretty much 80-90% of the time, since I want to learn the system, but for the remaining 20% and the reasons mentioned above it's going to be windows :)</p>


<p>Let's see how I am going to manage, curious to see myslef in a half a year. I will definitely not crumble, since the Linux system is just so much more efficient I feel, I love using the terminal and and can't imagine mysefl editing text or code in anything else than Vim right now. So I am comforatble letting myself loose on not so major tasks like wow and image editing, since I will always come back to linux for my data science journey. So cheesy.</p>


<p>Alright, I continue being sick. Glad I found the time to type this one out.</p>

<blockquote>p.s. I should probably try to find some addon thingy for vim that would auto-correct the typing mistakes. I am fast as a lightning with this home row typing now, but sometimes a mistake slips in I guess. Sorry about that, I'll do somethig about it.</blockquote>
