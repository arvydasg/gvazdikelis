	<h1>Old version of "About me" page</h1>

	I am totally new to programming.<br>

	I have a Bachelors degree from some Danish university, something architecture/engineering related. Didn't find that occupation exciting anymore so I traveled the world for 2 years out of my savings. Corona and empty pockets got me back to my home country where I haven't been since graduating from high school. I am not about that 9-5 life doing things purely for the sake of money, I want to feel some kind of meaning and see the usefulness in my work and enjoy doing it, without feeling physically trapped in one place in one area of expertise. I thought a lot about it in my free time back here in Lithuania and I feel that programming and all that stuff will allow me that. Work on a variety of different fields that I might find enjoyable, do it from anywhere in the world and of course having a lot of computer time.<br>

	Not sure why, but I am especially interested in Machine Learning and AI. Also no other programming language attracts me like python (don't know any programming knowledge, just the word and the use of it I guess attracts me).<br>

	Somehow hearing in the programming community that one of the best operating systems for programming is Mac and Linux. I have a 7 year old laptop, so I was thinking I will buy myself a mac and by like all the other cool kids. But instead I decided to save that chunk of money and work with my acer as long as it allows me to, so I switched from being a lifetime Windows user to being a Linux user. I like it so far. Like to find people that explain Linux well and I started to notice that the commands I am learning in Linux will be very much useful in various environments around programming world. or w/e. So I guess I made a right choice. I am kind of a perfectionist, always trying to optimize everything in my life and try to make good decisions from the start, so I thought instead of nano text editor, which one is the best out there? After lots of research I figured that Vim will be my choice, with bloat free Artix Linux as my distribution and DWM windows manager to reduce the strain on my old laptop as much as possible.<br>

	So there are lots of things to learn for a new person to programming. Linux and all of that jazz (Luke Smith mostly), Python (Udemy course with Jose Portilla), Machine Learning (Coursera course with Andrew Ng), Web development to create my website (StudioWeb course with Stefan Mischook).<br>

	Lots of things,yes, but I have a lot of free time and I am excited about learning and applying in practice all of those things.<br>
	I am curious what knowledge I will have when I read this again in 2022 :)<br>

	This is quite a good "about me" section, I don't know what made me be so open about myself on this platform, but I think I should use this on my website or something. Should try to build one as a side project :)<br>

	Alright, that is all about me. If you would like to give me some tips or just get in touch, feel free to do so!<br><br>

	Best,<br><br>
