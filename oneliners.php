<h2>Tendency Toward Complexity</h2>
<p>‘The history of the universe is a history of motion,’ Khader began, still looking at the boats nodding together like horses in harness. ‘The universe, as we know it, in this one of its many lives, began in an expansion that was so big, and so fast that we can talk about it, but we cannot in any truth understand it, or even imagine it. The scientists call this great expansion the Big Bang, although there was no explosion, in the sense of a bomb, or something like that. And the first moments after that great expansion, from the first fractions of attoseconds, the universe was like a rich soup made out of simple bits of things. 
Those bits were so simple that they were not even atoms yet. As the universe expanded and cooled down, these very tiny bits of things came together to make particles. Then the particles came together to make the first of the atoms. Then the atoms came together to make molecules. Then the molecules came together to make the first of the stars. Those first stars went through their cycles, and exploded in a shower of new atoms. The new atoms came together to make more stars and planets. All the stuff we are made of came from those dying stars. We are made out of stars, you and I. Do you agree with me so far?’<br>
'Sure,’ I smiled. ‘I don’t know where you’re going yet, but so far, so good.’ ‘Precisely!’ he laughed. ‘So far, so good. You can check the science of what I am saying to you—as a matter of fact, I want you to check everything that I say, and everything you ever learn from anyone else.</p>

There are too many variables to know the motivations behind that particular action at that particular time. Over-analyzing never added a second to anyone’s life. You’re going to be fine with or without them. If you have to alter your identity to win them back, then you’re not really winning anything.

“A relationship based on love… is one in which each partner allows the other to be what he or she chooses, with no expectations and no demands. It is a simple association of two people who love each other so much that each would never expect the other to be something that he or she wouldn’t choose for himself. It is a union of independence, rather than dependence."

<strong>Message to Aishwarya - 2020/05/30</strong>

"There are two ways. Of "what", I dont know. but I'm torn between those two so I cns not pick one to live by.
One - EVERYTHING  is okay.
other one - I pick and choose. 13:05

"Its the worst. I decided Ill write them down so somewehre and keeo the one where everything is okay in my mind as a real truth and live by the second one where I pick and choose.

Irealized something else juts now/ that humans can not live byy the real truth.


1st truth - EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

It is how it is. Evolution, tendency towards complexity, process, gradual, right, rpoper, inevitable. Where it grets interesting - religion - okay. No religion - okay. Spiritual - okay, not spiritual - okay. variaty, ego formations, nothing wrong, murder - okay, alive - okay, tragedy - okay, no trageedy - okay. Continuous, never ending process, learning from itself, developing by own(universe) "mistakes". Depresssion - okay, alchohol - okay, no self control - okay,no shame - okay, no goals - okay, no future plans - okay, addict - okay. all are just labels t labe l things which are done by the things that popped into exidtence nand gradually developed ego and THAT is also okay. EVERYTHING, EVERY EMOTION/ACTION is okay.

2nd - CONTROLLING 

you are the controller, ruler, master of your actions, thoughts, behavious, feelings, emotions, reactions, words, moods. cravings, addictions, surroundings, atitude, future and so on.You live by this "fake sense of control" when the ego is super strong (which is also okay according to the 1st truth). It needs control, feels good when having control over all that is mentioned above. Good example - buddhist monk or some youtube motivational speaker. Very pleasant image to look at, ostly admired by the 3rd category, but "laugher upon" by the 1st. but actually no, 1st is full of understanding, knowing that everything is okay, it is just different level.

3rd - REACTNG (decided there is a third way.

Category in whihc majority of current population falls in and are easily manipulated by TV, media, fashion, treds, lluxury items, offers, shiny things, discounts, newest topics, opinions of others, actions of others, weather, money.. what else?... life s of others, government, faily. friends, tastes, feelings, words... (lost train of thought because I just decuded ill take a pic and send all this to you, A)/

And so when I say Humans can not live by the first truth is because... we are humans, man. All of us have thus ego that has evolved from nothing, it is in each and evey one of us. If you say "I lost my ego" it just means your ego itself is giving you this feeling, you are very deep in the 2nd. All we can do is know the truth (1st) and then because we are on this planet in these surroundings, we have no choice, but choose between 2nd and 3rd.
